            <li>increase visibility of timeout - maybe have a play timer and pulse the color when time is getting short.</li>
            <li>slipstreaming</li>            
            <li>play speed credit.  Gain credit by moving quickly.  When out of credit, the system auto plays for you</li>
			<li>Rules/Help page</li>
            <li>?Post-game replay</li>
            <li>listing (or at least count) of active players in browser</li>
            <li>computer players to fill out the race (use reduced auto pick delay logic)</li>
            <li>make auto pick more aggressive (find distance to next corner, pick a gear that will hopefully get there)</li>
            <li>hosted a game, left & started a new game.  Connected as a watcher using a different browser: player list is empty</li>
            <li>improve chat in waiting room</li>
