			<h3>Game Info</h3>
			<p>Each running game will need to track which board it's using, and the current state of all players.</p>
			<p>I anticipate that we'll have a node app running the server, which will also serve up the client HTML5 app as static content.
				Communication will likely be done via websockets.  I would establish a channel for the game browser, and a separate channel for each game.</p>
			<h4>Boards</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Multiple boards must be available</li>
				<li>Each board should provide images for rendering</li>
				<li>The board should have a record of all spaces
					<ul>
						<li>Each space should reference the other spaces accessible from that space.</li>
						<li>accessible space references should be referred to as in, forward, and out. This will be used to ensure that available moves comply with lane traversal rules.</li>
						<li>Corner spaces will be flagged so that it can be determined whether a player finished a turn in a corner</li>
						<li>Pit stop spaces will also be specially marked so the system can determine if repairs should be made</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The board will also have a record of each corner, which will include the shortest and longest path counts for the corner and the number of stops required in that corner.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Players</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Each player will choose a unique car</li>
				<li>Each player record will track the current gear and damage</li>
				<li>Advanced games will track damage per vehicle component</li>
				<li>if any damage category reaches maximum, the player loses.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Vehicles</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Vehicles will provide images for display</li>
				<li>Each vehicle will allow 20 combined damage points for basic play</li>
				<li>For advanced play, vehicles may distribute 40 damage points as the player chooses across the following categories:
					<ul>
						<li>Engine (default: 6 DP)</li>
						<li>Transmission (default: 6 DP)</li>
						<li>Tires (default: 10 DP)</li>
						<li>Brakes (default: 6 DP)</li>
						<li>Suspension (default: 6 DP)</li>
						<li>Body (default: 6 DP)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Taking damage</h4>
			<p>This is a summary of the cases where damage may be taken, for each component of the vehicle.
				When playing with basic rules, all damage is applied to the overall vehicle damage points</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Engine
					<ul>
						<li>ALL players in 5th or 6th gear have a 20% chance of damage (determined individually) if ANY PLAYER rolls 20 spaces in 5th gear or 30 spaces in 6th gear.</li>
						<li>The space where damage is taken becomes dangerous.</li>
						<li>Losing all DP results in elimination</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Transmission
					<ul>
						<li>N-1 damage is taken for down shifting by N gears.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Tires
					<ul>
						<li>Up to 3 damage for braking</li>
						<li>1 DP for each space on overshooting a corner</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Brakes
					<ul>
						<li>Up to 3 damage for braking</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Suspension
					<ul>
						<li>5% chance of damage on passing over or landing on a dangerous space.</li>
						<li>Losing all suspension DP results in elimination</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Body
					<ul>
						<li>Players have a 20% chance of damage when immediately adjacent to another vehicle at the end of movement for either vehicle.
							This damage will be applied prior to the slipstream rule, if applicable.  This rule should be applied for each adjacent vehicle.</li>
						<li>The space where damage is taken becomes dangerous.</li>
						<li>Losing all body DP results in elimination</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Gameplay</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Players will take turns moving their vehicles
					<ul>
						<li>The vehicle in the lead will move first, while the vehicle trailing will move last.</li>
						<li>Inside track spaces will be considered ahead of spaces farther out.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>For each turn, the player must select the gear they wish to use
					<ul>
						<li>Players may shift up by one gear.</li>
						<li>Players may shift down by one gear without taking damage</li>
						<li>If a player down shifts by N gears, they will take N-1 damage points.
							<ul>
								<li>In advanced play, damage is applied to the transmission.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>If a player has no damage points available, they cannot shift down by more than one gear</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>After selecting a gear, the system will randomly select the number of movement points for the player on this turn.  The distribution of the random numbers will depend
					on the random implementation used, and is not guaranteed.
					<ul>
						<li>1st gear: 1-2 movement points</li>
						<li>2nd gear: 2-4 movement points</li>
						<li>3rd gear: 4-8 movement points</li>
						<li>4th gear: 7-12 movement points</li>
						<li>5th gear: 11-20 movement points</li>
						<li>6th gear: 19-30 movement points</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once the number of movement points has been determined, the player will be presented with a choice of which space to move to.
					<ul>
						<li>Players may elect to use up to 6 damage points to reduce the distance traveled
							<ul>
								<li>Decrease spaces to move (not necessarily movement points, see Hills below) by 1 for each DP taken.</li>
								<li>For advanced play: the first three DP apply to brakes, the second three DP apply to tires.</li>
								<li>Braking by 7+ spaces will destroy the vehicle, regardless of available DP</li>
								<li>If insufficient DP are available, the car is destroyed.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Players cannot drive through other vehicles.  They must drive around them or brake to avoid hitting them.</li>
						<li>If the road is blocked by other vehicles, players must brake.</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When driving through a straight, players may only traverse lanes in one direction.
					<ul>
						<li>Weaving back and forth is not permitted.</li>
						<li>Players may move over one lane, then immediately back to pass another vehicle.</li>
						<li>Two-way lane traversal in corners is permitted as long as the movement follows the allowed movements for the corner space.</li>
						<li>This will require that we track what lanes a car has been in (except when passing) for each straight</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Each corner has a number indicating how many times a player must finish moving while in that corner.
					<ul>
						<li>Overshooting the corner on the final stop results in damage to tires.</li>
						<li>Overshooting the corner prior to the final stop destroys the car.</li>
						<li>If a vehicle loses all tire DP from overshooting, the car spins out - place it backwards on the space.
							<ul>
								<li>On the next turn, return the car to the forward direction, and start driving in 1st gear.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>If all tire DP are gone, overshooting by 1 causes the car to spin out. (see above)</li>
						<li>Overshooting by more than the available tire DP destroys the car.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Any time a car is destroyed, the space where the movement ended is marked as dangerous.</li>
				<li>For advanced play, if a player ends a move immediately behind another vehicle, and both vehicles are in 4th gear or higher, the player in the rear
					is in the slipstream of player in front, and may optionally move three additional spaces.
					<ul>
						<li>Players may use braking to reduce the number of spaces moved.</li>
						<li>Normal movement rules apply.</li>
						<li>If the movement from slipstream rules results in ending immediately behind another player in 4th gear or higher, the slipstream rule is applied again.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Hills</h4>
			<p>higher gears require more movement points to traverse (1 pt for 1st and 2nd, 2pt for 3rd and 4th, 3pt for 5th and 6th)</p>
			<h4>Pit Stops</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Players must have movement points equal to or higher than the distance to the pit to make use of a pit stop.</li>
				<li>Excess movement points are discarded with no penalty</li>
				<li>All tire damage is repaired.</li>
				<li>On the turn after the pit stop: 50/50 chance of a quick stop or a slow stop.</li>
				<li>For a quick pit stop
					<ul>
						<li>Leave the pit in 4th gear<li>
						<li>Even chances of moving between 1 and 5 spaces when exiting (replaces normal movement)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>For a slow pit stop
					<ul>
						<li>Skip one turn</li>
						<li>Leave the pit in 4th gear or lower (normal movement applies)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
